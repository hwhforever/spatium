This is a single HTML file project that uses React and Tailwind CSS via CDN links. The project features:

- A ProjectTile component that creates a macOS-style squircle tile
- Dark theme with gray background
- Electric blue hover effects with animated glow
- Modern design with inner shadows and depth
- Responsive layout using Tailwind CSS classes

When making changes:
- Keep the component self-contained within the single HTML file
- Use CDN links for external dependencies
- Maintain the macOS-inspired design aesthetic
- Preserve the electric blue hover animation effects
